    The algorithm starts with combining columns that are needed for the
    algorithm and dropping the ones that are not needed. For instance the
    count data, together with the data of the total amount count, they are
    combined. Based on the adjusted data, a matrix is formed. After importing 
    NearestNeigbours from sklearn.neighbors, a knn model is created. This is 
    filled with the matrix. queryIndex will go to the global function
    CheckAndGetHistory to get an array filled with relevant items. 
    
    The first for-loop loops through the array to get the distances. Within
    the loop is a try except just in case new products would be added to the
    database and there is only one neighbor. Each of the distances are then 
    added to the previously empty list ItemId. Afterwards, a new empty list
    called idList is made fot the second for-loop. The second for loop loops
    through the items in the ItemId list and adds one to the index due to the
    index starting at 0 and the products starting at 1. The value of the array
    is obviously used to find the ID of the products in the database.

    IMPORTANT NOTES - Take a look at this later:
    In pandas the index starts at 0. Unlike SQL, where the index starts at 1. 
    Since we need to look up items in the inventory, employewithitem and
    employeelist, it will make the job easier by setting the index at 1, 
    so we don't have to add 1 the whole time while writing code.

    Due to the top 1 percent being a small amount borrowed items, we took the top 5-6% instead.
